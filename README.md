# Introduction

In this assignment I aim to make an adventure game where 2 player face each other in a 5x5 grid trying to reach the treasure. The treasure is randomly placed in the 5x5 grid and both player start at (0,0), the top left corner of the grid. Additionally, there are traps in the grid that the player must avoid because if the player hits too many traps then the will continue to loose health until they die. Once the player is dead the other player automatically wins. There are also power ups in the grid that allow the player to gain health or a hint to where the treasure is. Lastly, there is obstacles that the player cannot interact with and their purpose in the grid is to diversify the route to the treasure.
